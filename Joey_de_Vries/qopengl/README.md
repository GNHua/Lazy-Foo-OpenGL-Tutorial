With Joey's OpenGL tutorial, I previously used PyOpenGL and glfw to learn it. 

Here, my goal is to use the OpenGL support from PyQt5, so the code has fewer dependencies. 

From my internet search, the material on how to use PyQt5 OpenGL bindings is rare. Most of what I found was people using PyQt4 or PyQt5 along with PyOpenGL. Hopefull, the code here shines some light on the subject.
